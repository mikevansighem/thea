Thea is used to control the environment of model (train) layouts based
on real-world data and simulation models. Current development is focused
around lighting but we plan to expand the functionalities to include sound 
and actuator control.

## Origin

This project was started in order to control lighting of model-train
layouts in more interesting ways. Most solutions only offer manual
and rule based control resulting in very predictive behavior. Thea
breaks with this by controlling the model environment based on real-word
data and simulation models that introduce an element of randomness.

## Principles

-   Science based environment simulation;
-   Simple to start but complex if you want to;
-   Modern user interface;
-   Support for common hardware;

## Features

Currently Thea is in early development so the list of available features
is a bit short. However we have a lot planned. Have a look underneath for the most
exciting ones, for the full list head over to the 
[planned features](https://mikevansighem.github.io/thea/PLANNED) 
section of our documentation.

-   [x] Accelerated model time;
-   [ ] Day and night cycle;
-   [ ] Hardware control over MQTT;
-   [ ] Household lighting;
-   [ ] Weather patterns;
-   [ ] Traffic;
-   [ ] Opening-hours;
-   [ ] Graphical user interface;
-   [ ] Moon and stars;
-   [ ] DCC train control;
-   [ ] Weather sounds.

## Getting started

For an end user it might be a bit early to get started however
if you really want to give Thea a try already head over to our
[getting started guide](https://mikevansighem.github.io/thea/getting_started/)
and follow the instructions. In case you would like to contribute head over to the
[contributing](https://mikevansighem.github.io/thea/contibuting) section
of our documentation. We are happy to receive pull-requests.
